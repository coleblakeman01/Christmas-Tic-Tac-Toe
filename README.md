# Christmas-Tic-Tac-Toe
<h4> This is my Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. <h4>
<h4> The game is fully responsive for all screen sizes <h4>
<h4> The game will end once a user has won, not allowing any more boxes to be filled. My game has also none of the bugs that many tic tac toe games
have, such as restricting double clicking the same box. The winner is also announced at the top of the screen and resets after each game. <h4>
